# Summary

*Updates*  
**11/12:** Now XY_bearings_R is fix.
**11/7:**: ramps support internal. a little less plastic to print. new printed cube. now with 3 holes to put 3 m3x20 in. It makes your cube as solid as aluminium version ! definitely.
**10/23:** bom added. sorry for the delay.
**10/06:** new motor support right to align better and be more consistent with the left one. Some little changes in all models to help ease of assembly.

**09/18:** Bigger pulley_608 hole, smooth Xrod_support and endstop, new XY_bearings_LR for easier assembly, add slit on Z_slide and bigger nuts hole on Y_Slide_LR   

**09/16:** Add idler_pulley and new XY_bearings R L  

**08/27:** scalu_Y_rod_motor_support_R was missing. good now.
***  
Here is our last SmartrapCore evolution :   
**The SmartrapCore ALU!**  

http://smartfriendz.com/en/home/54-smartrapcore-alu.html  
   
Now aluminium profiles are becoming mainstream , we can enjoy the more modern look, the assembly benefit , thanks to hammer nuts, and the stability in time of aluminium.  

Like all our designs, this model is **full , active, open source** and you are welcome to build one.  
The assembly documentation is on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQFCcp26U0U&list=PLOC55t9dY7y94dfJ4VI-5qbKi7heZsKoJ  

the realtime 3d model is on sketchfab ( very usefull for asswembly ) . We are working on putting all screws and accessories in it, so eventually you would need only that to assemble the printer : 

https://sketchfab.com/models/10d76d1f459f489ab546df174f1a9d0b


This model was designed in onshape :   
https://cad.onshape.com/documents/086229ea796640d29acd68ff/w/2030a3358fd641da896d20a5/e/1e4ef00263ee4eae9316731a  

We , at smartfriendz, found this new CAD software the best solution to share our open designs . Everybody with a little learning path will be able to copy it and modify simple things , or make new accessories.  


*The Smartrapcore standard is still active and you will find the new version of the design ( evolution ) in the very same onshape document. Only the openjscad version will not be updated.*  




# Additional objects to print

The ramps support on the side is there :
